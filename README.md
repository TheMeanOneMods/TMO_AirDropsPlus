# TMO_AirDropsPlus

# Tired of boring single supply drops?
With TMO's  Air Drops PLUS, every plane arrival turns into a true event. Watch as multiple supply crates rain down in timed intervals, making the skies feel alive with survival opportunities.

# ✦ Features
Multiple Drops – Configurable extra crates (up to 3 max). So this means, up to 3 more in addition to the vanillas Single! 
Immersive Timing – Each crate falls 5 seconds apart, as if staggered from the plane. This keeps them spread out so one player isnt hogging all of the loot!
TMO-Core Required – Ensures stability, balance, and seamless integration.
ServerSide-Friendly – Fully EAC-safe, tested, and multiplayer-ready. Server Download is all thats required of this and the core.
Simple Configuration – Just one clean XML option (ExtraDrops
). You can add up to 3 Extra Air Drops at a time. 4 Maximum per Supply Plane Spawn! 

# ✦ Why Use Air Drops PLUS?
No more wondering if that single crate was worth it. Now you’ll need to decide which crate to chase first while others drift away — adding tension, excitement, and strategy to every drop. Oh, and TheMeanOne Made it.. so you know itll be maintained! :)
